# Automate Job Seeking Software
Match the Best Candidates with the Best Job Vacancies 

**Introduction**

The labor market in Sri Lanka is highly competitive, and job seekers face significant challenges in finding suitable best job vacancies. On the other hand, Employers struggle to find the right qualified candidates for their job vacancies. The Current methods of job search and selection, such as job advertisements on websites and social media platforms, are not always effective in matching job vacancies with suitable candidates. There is a need for an automated platform that can streamline the job search and selection process (recruitment process) and make it more efficient and effective.

The proposed research aims to design an automated platform that can effectively match job vacancies with suitable candidates based on relevant factors. The research will be conducted using the Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM) to design, implement and evaluate an effective and usability automation platform that can address the challenges of the current job market in Sri Lanka. The study area for this research is Sri Lanka, and the specific objectives of the study are to identify the most important factors for matching job vacancies with suitable candidates, design an automated platform that can effectively match job vacancies with candidates, and evaluate the effectiveness and usability of the platform in real-world scenarios. In brief, it aims to bridge the gap between job seekers and employers and make the job search and selection process more efficient and effective.
